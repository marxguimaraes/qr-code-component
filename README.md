## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to exercise the use of CSS Flex. I'm particularly proud of my method for placing the elements on the page since that's something that was pretty challenging when I first learned CSS.

```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-grow: 8;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

There isn't much to be added to this project since its has a pretty simple concept and purpose but I plan to add a link to my website when thats done.
